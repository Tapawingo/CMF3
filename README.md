# Eric's Mission Framework
This framework is merely just a collection of functions i've written for various CC missions over the last 2 years i've been in CC.
It is a weird collection of spaghetti code and extremely buggy code overall that get's changed constantly to work better for a mission.
## How to install
if you are fancy tech guy who has installed git you can just git clone this repository into your mission root directory, or if you aren't that fancy just download the zip and extract into your root mission directory.
For more info on how to actually use it refer to the github wiki, if it exists yet, if it doesn't ask me i guess.
