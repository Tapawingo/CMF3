**CMF3** is an effort by the **Cluster Community Mod Team** to enhance the individual experience by our playerbase.

This framework is entirely open source and all contributions are welcome. Feel free to maintain your own custom version, so long as the changes you make are open to the public in accordance with the GNU General Public License ([GPLv3]()).

An attempt has been made to build the framework modularly so almost any *module* can easily be removed from the configuration. This way, a team can maintain it's own tailored version of **CMF3** by simply excluding any components they don't need. The entire framework has been built with customization in mind allowing mission designers to tweak it to suit their needs.

It should be noted that **CMF3** has been developed with **Cluster Community** as it's focus and therefore contains features that will only be available on the **Cluster Community Server**.

For a quick rundown on installing, configuring and running **CMF3** refer to the [Cluster Community Wiki](https://zeus.cluster-community.com/index.php/Category:Eric%27s_Mission_Framework_(EMF)).

## Core Features
- Role-based arsenal whitelist
- Multiplayer virtual garage
- Respawn limiter
- Rallypoint system based on Squads system
- Safestart system to prevent players from killing eachother at game start.
- An enhanced vehicle system that simulates more realistic offroad driving and prevents unrealistic explosions.
