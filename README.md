# Eric's Mission Framework
This is a collection of functions for arma 3 mission makers made by the cluster community development team (which i'm the only remnant) to enhance the experience for our playerbase.
## How to install
if you are fancy tech guy who has installed git you can just git clone this repository into your mission root directory, or if you aren't that fancy just download the zip and extract into your root mission directory.
For more info on how to actually use it refer to the [github wiki](https://github.com/Tapawingo/Eric-s-Mission-Framework/wiki), if it exists yet, if it doesn't ask me i guess.
