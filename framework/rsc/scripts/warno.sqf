/* SITUATION */
private _situation = "While West-German and U.S. forces were conducting the annual exercise Reforger in West-Germany East-German and Soviet Forces launched an attack on the British controlled West-German region of Celle.
This attack was completly unseen by Army Intelligence as it is the dumbest time to launch an attack into West-Germany with West-German, British and U.S. Forces literally training for a simulated attack by East-German and Soviet forces.
Regardless the attack was launched and coalition forces are scrambling to set up defensive lines and pull in supply. A U.S. reconnaissance team has spotted Soviet troops staging for an assault at Eschede. Due to the presence of 
Amphibious Vehicles it is believed their target will be the City of Celle. <br/>

Setup for an ambush at Ambush Point (AP) Bravo and interdict the enemy vehicles on Main Supply Route (MSR) Newport until 2nd Platoon is setup at Vorwerk. Once 2nd platoon is setup fall back to Battle Point (BP) Delta and 
get set to disrupt the enemy formation as they push Hehlentor. Once the enemy starts utilizing Alternate Supply Route (ASR) Prince fall back to Battle Point (BP) Echo and contain the enemy North-East of Vorwerk. 2nd Platoon 
will have fallen back as well at this point. Keep delaying the enemy for as long as possible while keeping your fallback route to Battle Point (BP) Foxtrot open. Once the fallback route is close to being compromised fallback 
to Battle Point (BP) Foxtrot. Defend from Battle Point (BP) Foxtrot until unfeasible and pull in the defensive line to Hehlentor proper defending the town until unfeasible or U.S. Reinforcements have arrived.
